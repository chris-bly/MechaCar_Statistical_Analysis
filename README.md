# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
## Purpose and Objective
The objective of this challenge was to utilize the R programming language to perform statistical analyses on a dataset containing automotive miles per gallon (MPG) information for 50 different prototype MechaCars(tm) as well as a dataset with production information for suspension coils produced in distinct production lots. Hypothesis testing was also used as part of the statistical analysis. <br><br> All programming was performed in RStudio using R version 4.1.2.

## Results
### Deliverable 1: Linear Regression to Predict MPG
<kbd>![Linear Regression of MPG Data](Resources/linear_regression.png)</kbd>
- Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?

### Deliverable 2: Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

**Summary of Suspension Coils by Manufacturing Lot**<br>

- The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

### Deliverable 3: t-Tests on Suspension Coils
**t-Test of All Suspension Coils vs. Population Mean of 1500 Pounds per Square Inch (PSI)<br>

- briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary.
